# Perceptron

This folder contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm

## Overview

The Perceptron is a binary classifier effective on linearly separable data. It was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt.
This Python implementation of the Perceptron demonstrates its learning capability by training on a simple, linearly separable, 3d dataset. The program outputs which point it's looking at and the corresponding weight update as it trains.
