# Adaline

This folder contains a Python implementation of the ADALINE algorithm, an early machine learning model and successor of the Perceptron

## Overview

ADALINE (ADAptive LINear Element) is a binary classifier that works best on linearly separable data, but can find the best linear solution even if no perfect linear solution exists. This implementation trains on the same simple 3d dataset as the Perceptron. This folder contains four versions of the ADALINE algorithm: Gradient Descent with and without data normalization, 
    and Stochastic Gradient Descent with and without data normalization to demonstrate the effectiveness of each on the same dataset.
